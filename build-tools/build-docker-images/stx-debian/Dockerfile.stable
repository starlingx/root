# To enable a repo list:
#     cp /etc/apt/sources.list.d/$repo_list.disabled \

# By default only stx.list is enabled, which includes only the packages
# built by stx tools, and the binary packages from the curated binary
# download lists (bullseye-base.lst etc).
#
# Enabling the upstream repos ("debian.list") is dangerous because it
# may conflict with packages in stx.list.
#
#
# FIXME: apt evaluates these files in alphabetical order, so stx.list
#        comes after debian.list. When the local binary repo contains
#        the same package/version as the debian repo, apt will download
#        it from debian, regardless of the priority in /etc/apt/preferences.
#        We should rename these files to make stx.list sort before
#        debian.list. This would affect Loci scripts in
#        loci/docker/stx-scripts/
