Debian
======

debian/Dockerfile:
- disable upstream repo, use only the managed packages.
  Requires additions to download lists in stx-tool.
- convert thrifty & nss to wheels and don't install them in Dockerfile

build-wheel-tarball.sh:
- current DEB wheel packages install wheels at random locations.
  Fix them and remove the workaround in this script.

build-wheel-tarball.sh:
- look for wheels in non-Starlingx DEBs. Requires accessing repomgr via
  the REST API (?)
- support layered builds (ie scan DEBs from lower layers)

debian/openstack-requirements:
- requirements are not compatible with debian/bullseye
